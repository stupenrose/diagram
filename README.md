# The Idea

It's an old concept: separate structure/data from presentation.  This applies it to diagrams:

  - The underlying graph data (nodes, connections, etc) comes from somewhere else (you decide)
  - The 2d visual presentation/format (object location, object presentation, line format, line routing, etc) lives in this tool
